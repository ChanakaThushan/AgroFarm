<h3>Most of countries are using this new technology for their farming</h3>
<p> Across the globe, an increasing number of countries are embracing new technologies to revolutionize their agricultural practices. This widespread adoption of cutting-edge tools and innovations in farming signifies a transformative shift towards more sustainable, efficient, and resilient agricultural systems. Precision farming technologies, such as GPS-guided machinery and sensor-driven monitoring systems, have become integral components of modern agriculture, enabling farmers to optimize resource use and enhance productivity. Drones and unmanned aerial vehicles are being deployed for precision crop monitoring, disease detection, and yield prediction, providing farmers with invaluable insights. Automation, including robotic tractors and smart irrigation systems, is reducing labor demands and improving the precision of tasks, resulting in increased efficiency and reduced environmental impact.</p>

                              <p>Biotechnology tools like CRISPR are revolutionizing crop breeding, allowing for the development of varieties with enhanced resistance to pests, diseases, and changing climate conditions. Countries are also leveraging blockchain technology to enhance transparency and traceability in their agricultural supply chains, fostering trust among consumers. This global shift towards incorporating advanced technologies in agriculture is not only driven by the pursuit of increased yields but also by the imperative to address environmental sustainability and food security challenges. By embracing these innovations, countries are positioning themselves at the forefront of a tech-driven agricultural revolution that holds the promise of meeting the demands of a growing population while safeguarding the planet's resources</p>
